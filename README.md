# Rush-MVC
Three days project attempting to recreate a MVC architecture from scratch.

Using Php, we had to use a specific pattern to create a website. The famous Models, Controllers and Vue.
We had to create a router, a http parser, a core application and a dispatcher using only our own methods.

Very challenging project but very useful to understand how a website architecture should be working.
